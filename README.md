# Welcome to DirectLook

## What is DirectLook?

DirectLook helps you to get rid of an unattractive effect while capturing videos from your webcam. If you use your build-in webcam from your laptop or a dedicated webcam, you are mostly looking on the screen and not in the camera.  
So you are unable to look directly in the camera while your are looking at the screen.

## Features

- uses OpenNI to access the MS Kinect (Kinect for Windows and ASUS Xtion are **not** supported so far)
- reconstructs the scene with the collected data
- you can rotate and pan your head within the digital scene

DirectLook was developed at the University of Applied Science Darmstadt, Germany (Hochschule Darmstadt).  
We are all Computer Science students and we developed this over a time of two semesters.  
Prof. E. Hergenroether and Prof. J. Wietzke from our department supported us over this time.

## Installation

After the checkout, there are a few zip files in the dep-folder. Just extract these files there and after this all dependencies are usable.  
For connecting to the device, you have to install OpenNI and SensorKinect, in this order. We also serve the working installers in the dep-folder.
