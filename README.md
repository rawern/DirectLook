# Welcome to DirectLook

## What is DirectLook?

DirectLook helps you to get rid of an unattractive effect while capturing videos from your webcam. If you use your build-in webcam from your laptop or a dedicated webcam, you aremostly looking on the screen and not in the camera. So you are unable to look directly in the camera while your are looking at the screen.

## Features

- uses OpenNI to access the MS Kinect (Kinect for Windows is not supported)
- reconstructs the scene with the collected data
- rotate and pan your head within the digital scene

DirectLook was developed at the University of Applied Science Darmstadt, Germany (Hochschule Darmstadt).

We are all Computer Science students and we developed this over a time of two semesters.

Prof. E. Hergenroether and Prof. J. Wietzke from our department supported us over this time.

## Installation

After the checkout, there are a few zip files in die dep-folder. Just extract these files there and after this are all dependencies usable.

For connecting to the devices, you have to install OpenNI and SensorKinect, in this order. We also serve the working installer in the dep-folder.
